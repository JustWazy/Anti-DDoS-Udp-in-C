# Anti-DDoS-Udp-in-C
An anti-DDoS tool built in C programming language for UDP network protection at layer 4. This anti-DDoS utilizes a proxy detection API and a rate limiter to create two strong layers of protection. Feel free to provide feedback if there are any mistakes, as I am still a beginner in networking and C. I'm doing this as a learning project. Thank you for visiting! :3
